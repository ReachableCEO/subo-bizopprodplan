# Objectives and Challenges

[ref](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/project-pitch/)

The Objectives of Suborbital Phase I is to find the material and labor costs of producing an airworthy balloon which

- Complies with regulatory constraints (geofencing, etc) and safety.

- Carries an agnostic payload which can transmit without any interferences from our own avionics

- Withstands environmental conditions of high altitudes, such as, UV, low temperatures and low pressures.
  
- Has the ability to be serviced and maintained
  
- Has the ability to integrate to a larger network which meets the navigation and communication requirements 

This work could ultimately create a network of balloons that could be managed as an ISP for communities that do not have internet service.  It could also be used to move payloads for governments. Creating a government contracting firm that specializes in deploying balloons with agnostic payloads.
