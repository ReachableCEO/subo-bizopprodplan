Our SBIR Phase I will focus on the market viablity of the mass production of balloon technology to carry payloads for commercial and government use.  

### Origin
We originally began as a means to provide internet to groups not serviced by other businesses who saw it unprofitable to build the internet infrastructure for these communities. 

### Key Innovations
We have curated and integrated a unique set of open source technologies that have only recently become widely available.

- Tile38
- Throw in some machine learning or blockchain if you need too. 


### Applied Research
Furthermore, we are applying promising theoretical research on balloon technology.
